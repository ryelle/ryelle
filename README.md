## Hello üëã

I‚Äôm ryelle, a web developer based in Philadelphia, working remotely. I work on WordPress, specifically the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù side ‚Äî WordPress.org, WordCamp.org, and other tools that help contributors contribute.

Some code I'm proud of:

- All of the child themes across WordPress.org, for example [Pattern Directory](https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/tree/trunk/public_html/wp-content/themes/wporg-pattern-directory-2024), [Theme Directory](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-theme-directory/tree/trunk/source/wp-content/themes/wporg-themes-2024), [Five for the Future](https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future/tree/production/themes/wporg-5ftf-2024), [Photo Directory](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-photo-directory/tree/trunk/source/wp-content/themes/wporg-photos-2024), which were based on [the parent theme](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021/tree/trunk/source/wp-content/themes/wporg-parent-2021) to set up basic design tokens like colors, typography, and spacing.
- [Query Filters](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-mu-plugins/tree/trunk/mu-plugins/blocks/query-filter), a custom block for the WordPress.org directories. This uses the Interactivity API to create a custom select UI, created in close collaboration with designers. This can be seen on any of the directories, for example the [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) or the [Photo Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/).
- [grab-screenshots](https://github.com/ryelle/grab-screenshots) uses puppeteer and @wordpress/e2e-test-utils to automatically take screenshots, possibly after simulated user interactions. See [Taking 72 Screenshots in 5 Minutes](https://ryelle.codes/2020/12/taking-72-screenshots-in-5-minutes/) for my use case and some examples. I used a similar approach to get screenshots to [help review changed pages in WordPress.org](https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-main-2022/pull/467).
- [css-audit](https://github.com/WordPress/css-audit) is a tool for auditing CSS for poor practices (for example, use of `!important`, or overly-long selectors). This tool parses each CSS file and creates an AST with PostCSS, which the audits traverse to pull out data.
